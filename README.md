# guessing_game
Guessing Game based on the second chapter of "The Rust Programming Language" by Steve Klabnik & Carol Nichols. Here is the link to the book, https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ .
This is my first real exploration into Rust.
Please give any feedback on better ways to accomplish the same goals here.
